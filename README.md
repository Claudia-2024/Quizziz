Project Description:
    The Quizziz Platform is a digital system designed to automate the process of course evaluations in universities. It allows students to evaluate their courses through structured online questionnaires, accessible via mobile interfaces.
The project aims to:
• Simplify the evaluation process.
• Increase student participation through mobile accessibility.
• Provide real-time analytical reports to teachers, department heads, and administrators.
• Contribute to the continuous improvement of teaching quality.

 Project Context :
Academic Context
This project was assigned within the framework of a university software engineering course, aiming to help students apply systems analysis and design principles in solving real-world academic challenges.
Technological and Societal Context
In an era where higher education institutions in Cameroon are transitioning toward digital transformation, the Quizziz Platform aligns with national and institutional goals to promote smart campuses.
It addresses societal needs for:
• Transparency in course evaluation.
• Better use of data for decision-making.
• Digital inclusion for students and teachers through accessible online tools.
 

Technology Decisions:
MVC (model view controller) architecture: This is because it is Easier to maintain, test, and understand each component independently.
Angular: This is because it has built-in tools and consistent structure
React Native: This is because it has a single code base for both iOS and Android apps
Express: This is because it is perfect for REST APIs with clean routing and HTTP method support
Render: This is because It offers deployment at low or no cost.

Challenges: 
- Implementing the grading of open ended questions
- Difficulties Learning Sequelize
